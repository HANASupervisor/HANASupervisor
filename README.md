## 📂 Featured Projects
### 🌟 [Project Name 1](#) Deriving Promising Technologies from UAM Patent Data
- **Description**: This project analyzed UAM (Urban Air Mobility) patent data to identify promising technologies that have high potential for innovation and growth. By leveraging advanced clustering and topic modeling techniques, the study provided actionable insights for technology development and commercialization.
- **Highlights**:
Performed k-means clustering using the Elbow Method in Python to define optimal clusters.
Used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with UMass Coherence and Cosine Similarity metrics to extract and validate key topics from patent text.
Created interactive bubble charts in R to visually represent the technological landscape.
Combined findings with Tableau dashboards for clear and intuitive reporting.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, R, Tableau, scikit-learn, gensim etc.

### 🌟 [Project Name 2](#) Predicting Parkinson's Progression and Recommending Therapy Intensity
- **Description**: Developed a predictive model to assess the progression of Parkinson's disease and proposed a system enabling in-home language rehabilitation therapy for patients. The goal was to minimize hospital visits by providing personalized therapy intensity recommendations based on disease progression.
- **Highlights**:
Built a predictive model using XGBoost to classify Parkinson's progression stages with high accuracy.
Designed an adaptive recommendation system that suggests therapy intensity tailored to the progression level.
Focused on creating a scalable, home-friendly solution to enhance the quality of life for Parkinson's patients.
Explored integration opportunities for real-time usage in in-home therapy devices.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Tableau
